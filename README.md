# 535-project2
It's a small world

Description: 
The project is to design an algorithm that calculates the shortest connection between movie casts. The first two casts on the list are the most important, such that if there is at least one string in common, the shortest connection is 1. If those two casts have no strings in common, then look for another cast in the list of casts that has a string in common, and the shortest connection is 2. Otherwise, the shortest connection is more than 2 or there is no connection.
